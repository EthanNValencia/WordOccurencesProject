  Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br />
  Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore&mdash;<br />
  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br />
  As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br />
  “’Tis some visiter,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door&mdash;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Only this and nothing more.”</span>
  Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br />
  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br />
  Eagerly I wished the morrow;&mdash;vainly I had sought to borrow<br />
  From my books surcease of sorrow&mdash;sorrow for the lost Lenore&mdash;<br />
  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore&mdash;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Nameless here for evermore.</span>
  And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br />
  Thrilled me&mdash;filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br />
  So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br />
  “’Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door&mdash;<br />
  Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   This it is and nothing more.”</span>
  Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br />
  “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br />
  But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br />
  And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br />
  That I scarce was sure I heard you”&mdash;here I opened wide the door&mdash;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Darkness there and nothing more.</span>
  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br />
  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;<br />
  But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br />
  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”<br />
  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”&mdash;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Merely this and nothing more.</span>
  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br />
  Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.<br />
  “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;<br />
  Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery explore&mdash;<br />
  Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;&mdash;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   ’Tis the wind and nothing more.”</span>
  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br />
  In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.<br />
  Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he,<br />
  But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door&mdash;<br />
  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door&mdash;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</span>
  Then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br />
  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br />
  “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,<br />
  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore&mdash;<br />
  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br />
  Though its answer little meaning&mdash;little relevancy bore;<br />
  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br />
  Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door&mdash;<br />
  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   With such name as “Nevermore.”</span>
  But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only<br />
  That one word, as if its soul in that one word he did outpour<br />
  Nothing farther then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered&mdash;<br />
  Till I scarcely more than muttered: “Other friends have flown before&mdash;<br />
  On the morrow <i>he</i> will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Then the bird said “Nevermore.”</span>
  Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br />
  “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store,<br />
  Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br />
  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore&mdash;<br />
  Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Of ‘Never&mdash;nevermore.’”</span>
  But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br />
  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;<br />
  Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br />
  Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore&mdash;<br />
  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”</span>
  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br />
  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;<br />
  This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br />
  On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,<br />
  But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   <i>She</i> shall press, ah, nevermore!</span>
  Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br />
  Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br />
  “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee&mdash;by these angels he hath sent thee<br />
  Respite&mdash;respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!<br />
  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
  “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!&mdash;prophet still, if bird or devil!&mdash;<br />
  Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br />
  Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted&mdash;<br />
  On this home by Horror haunted&mdash;tell me truly, I implore&mdash;<br />
  Is there&mdash;<i>is</i> there balm in Gilead?&mdash;tell me&mdash;tell me, I implore!”<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
  “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!&mdash;prophet still, if bird or devil!<br />
  By that Heaven that bends above us&mdash;by that God we both adore&mdash;<br />
  Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br />
  It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore&mdash;<br />
  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
  “Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting&mdash;<br />
  “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!<br />
  Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken!<br />
  Leave my loneliness unbroken!&mdash;quit the bust above my door!<br />
  Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br />
  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br />
  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming<br />
  And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor;<br />
  And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 20%">                                   Shall be lifted&mdash;nevermore!</span>
