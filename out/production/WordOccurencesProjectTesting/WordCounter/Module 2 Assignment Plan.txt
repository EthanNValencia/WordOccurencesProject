Requirements: 
The program will need to create files, read files, write text to files, access a web page, and determine what information is relevant on the web page. 

To do this I will execute iterations. I will test each iteration until it is satisfactory. 

Iteration 1
First I will write a program that reads whatever webpage I give it. 

Iteration 2
Second I will write a program that processes the webpage text. This will involve removing text that is not desirable. 

Iteration 3
Once the HTML and needless text has been cleaned, then the application will proceed to count the remaining words.
